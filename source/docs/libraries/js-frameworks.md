# Javascript frameworks

* [React Security](https://reactsecurity.io/)
* [Angular Security Guide](https://angular.io/guide/security)
* [Security Best Practices for Express in Production](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html)
* Vue: A security guide exists for [version 2](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/security.html), but I have found none for version 3 yet.
* Svelte: No security guide found

Hence the choice we made for React front-ends in our projects. And a work-in-progress for learning JS and pentesting JS applications.
