# Overview

* Implement [access control schemes](access-control.md)  Restrict access to database objects and functionality, according to the Principle of The Least Privilege (Insecure direct object references).
* Base [input validation](input-validation.md) on a whitelist. Use the most restrictive rule by default and allow special characters only by exception. This will reduce the attack surface for many vectors.
* Use [parameterised statements](parameterisation.md)
