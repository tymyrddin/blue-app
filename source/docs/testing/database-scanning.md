# Database frangibility scanning

An excellent tool would check passwords, default account vulnerabilities, login hours violations, account permissions, role permissions, unauthorized object owners, remote login and servers, system table permissions, extended stored procedures, cross database ownership chaining, authentication, login attacks, stale login ids, security of admin accounts, excessive admin actions, passwords, password ageing, auditing trail, auditing configuration, buffer overflows in user name and buffer overflows in database link. Don't think it exists, but every little bit helps.
